Description:

The project is to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game. We need to use parent and child components within React. The board has 9 squares and  two players “x” and ”o” .When the two  players start the game they need to select their symbols .whichever player wins the game it has to display the winner  respective symbol.

Installation :
We need to clone the files that are in the Tic-Tac-Toe directory to  your local machine.And drag and drop  the index.html file in to the browser. Here you can see the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Roadmap: 
Whenever the player clicks on a square a button has to  appear showing the player which move he is in , how many moves he is done and if he wins it has to stop displaying the buttons and show  him the winner message in another button .
